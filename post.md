## My Experience Teaching Children to Code

I'd like to share with you today my experience of teaching children (ages 13-18) how to code the basics of HTML and CSS.  Quick background on this guy... In December 2014, I was in the midst of a career transition and found myself not knowing where to go next.  I enrolled into a 12 week front end engineering bootcamp delivered by The Iron Yard Academy in Atlanta, GA.  Up to that point, my only coding experience was pasting YouTube iframes into a Wordpress post and completing a few modules in Codecademy's HTML/CSS basics course.  The technical know-how was there, and has always been there, yet I didn't have the structure, time, or patience to teach myself coding - I needed to be nurtured, and this Iron Yard program was the vehicle to learn from the expertise of an experienced mentor, Tim Whitacre.

Four weeks into the Iron Yard course, the administrators sent out an email asking for volunteers to help teach a Free Kids coding course they were starting, and they particularly wanted the help from the front end students because these kids would be taught HTML and CSS basics.  I jumped at the chance and threw my name into the hat of volunteers... At the time, I had no idea I was signing up for one of the most profound experiences of my life.

I've since blogged about my experiences with these kids and you can view the takeaways post [here](http://www.spencerwyckoff.com/completing-iron-yard-kids-finish-with-presentations/).  The truth is, I was born to be an educator - it's in my blood.  My mother left her high-paying stockbroker position of 15 years to start substitute teaching and is now a full-time fifth grade teacher with tons of accolades.  Her mantra is this - "I get to plant and nurture seeds in young minds so that they may become not just smarter kids, but high achieving contributors to our society."  Talk about a big vision and a big heart.  

Her mantra is exactly related to the profound experience I experienced for myself in teaching these kids HTML and CSS basics.  I was opening their eyes to what goes on behind the scenes of their YouTube and [CookieClicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) adventures (beware of the CookieClicker - you've been warned...).  I was helping plant the seeds of technology and creativity in a micro-farm of future societal contributors.  Was every child paying attention in class?  Most likely not.  However if I made an impact on just one child who later becomes the creator of something crucially important in our industry - then not only is it worth it, but it is necessary.  

I myself am one of these students.  At 26, and only 4 months into coding, I am a young seed being nurtured in this industry and strive to make lasting impact with my work.  That's why I greatly support a program like AirPair - because it's nurturing and empowering a community of people looking to achieve greatness through their creative talents.  Imagine a world where that type of empowerment and support was as free as the air we breathe.  Imagine what new pinnacles we could transcend to.  I'm excited for what the future holds for each of us and am curious what happens on the other end of this SUBMIT button.
